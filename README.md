# What in the world is this?

Oh hi there!

This is repository to archive a bunch of spaghetti code that I demo in the video series called Development Deepeties.

You can find folders for each episode. Hope you are hungry, cause there is a lot of spaghetti here.

#01 - [Aseprite animations export to Godot](https://youtu.be/HvJ5LK4Rvik)

> In today's deepity I talk about the use of Aseprite API to create a custom export script. Such script can write information about tags, frames and pretty much anything else into a txt file. Later we can load such file in the Godot engine code, to automatically animate sprites the same way they are animated in Aseprite.
